# ⚡ Overview

NOVA bridges the gap between high-end fashion and machine learning.

Instead of relying on manual quizzes, NOVA uses Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash vision model** to visually analyze a user's physical traits or current outfit.

It then queries a custom-built **vector database of real-world e-commerce products using Cosine Similarity** to recommend the perfect clothing matches.

---

# ✨ Key Features

## 🧠 Neural Lookbook (Get Clothes)

Drag and drop a photo into the glassmorphism scanner.

The AI extracts **5 core vectors**:

- Gender  
- Age Group  
- Occasion  
- Skin Tone  
- Style  

It instantly curates a **12-piece shoppable wardrobe** from a dataset of real ASOS products.

---

## 👗 Spatial Aesthetic Rater (Rate Outfit)

Upload a mirror selfie to receive a **dynamic 4-point breakdown**:

- Overall Rating  
- Color Harmony  
- Proportions  
- Trendiness  

Along with **actionable styling feedback**.

---

## ⚡ Hardware-Accelerated UI

A premium **Apple-tier interface** featuring:

- 3D magnetic hover physics  
- React-powered CSS scanning laser  
- Dynamic layout routing  
- GPU-accelerated animations powered by Framer Motion  

---

## 🛡️ Graceful Degradation System

The backend includes a **self-healing architecture**.

If the Google Gemini API rate limits the application (HTTP 429):

- The engine intercepts the crash  
- Generates realistic fallback data  
- Keeps the user experience completely uninterrupted  

---

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+  
- Python 3.10+  
- Google Gemini API Key  

---

# 1️⃣ Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_key_here"
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

---

# 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

Navigate to the web directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd nova-web
npm install
```

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

to interact with the **NOVA Neural Architecture**.

---

# 🧠 Data Engineering (ETL Pipeline)

NOVA does **not rely on dummy data**.

The project includes a custom scraper:

```
backend/ml/fetch_real_clothes.py
```

This script calls the **ASOS RapidAPI endpoint** to compile a dataset of real clothing items including:

- Product names  
- Prices  
- Images  
- Purchase URLs  

---

## ⚙️ On-the-Fly Vectorization

When the server boots:

1. **Pandas** loads the compiled dataset  
2. **Scikit-Learn** encodes the textual features  
3. The system builds **vector matrices in memory**

This avoids `.pkl` serialization issues across environments.
